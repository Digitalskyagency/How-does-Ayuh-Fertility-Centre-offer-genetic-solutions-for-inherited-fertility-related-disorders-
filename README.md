Ayuh Fertility Centre integrates advanced genetic testing to tackle inherited fertility challenges and reduce the risk of genetic disorders in offspring. Couples struggling with unexplained infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, or a family history of genetic disease often benefit from genetic counseling and testing. Ayuh uses Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT-A, PGT-M) to examine embryos for chromosomal abnormalities or specific inherited conditions before implantation. This ensures that only healthy embryos are selected, improving IVF success rates and reducing the risk of genetic transmission. For men or women with known genetic carriers, targeted testing helps determine if both partners carry mutations that may affect their child. Ayuh also offers carrier screening, karyotyping, and whole-genome analysis where necessary. These genetic insights guide customized treatment plans, including donor gametes if needed. The genetic experts at Ayuh work closely with fertility specialists to ensure healthy, genetically sound conception.
